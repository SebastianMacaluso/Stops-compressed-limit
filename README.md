# Stops-compressed-limit

Searches for supersymmetric top quarks at the LHC have been making great progress in
pushing sensitivity out to higher mass, but are famously plagued by gaps in coverage around
lower-mass regions where the decay phase space is closing off. Within the common stopNLSP
/ neutralino-LSP simplified model, the line in the mass plane where there is just
enough phase space to produce an on-shell top quark remains almost completely unconstrained.
Here, we show that is possible to define searches capable of probing a large patch
of this difficult region, with S/B ∼ 1 and significances often well beyond 5σ. The basic
strategy is to leverage the large energy gain of LHC Run 2, leading to a sizable population
of stop pair events recoiling against a hard jet. The recoil not only re-establishes a 6ET
signature, but also leads to a distinctive anti-correlation between the 6ET and the recoil jet
transverse vectors when the stops decay all-hadronically. Accounting for jet combinatorics,
backgrounds, and imperfections in 6ET measurements, we estimate that Run 2 will already
start to close the gap in exclusion sensitivity with the first few 10s of fb−1
. By 300 fb−1
,
exclusion sensitivity may extend from stop masses of 550 GeV on the high side down to
below 200 GeV on the low side, approaching the “stealth” point at mt˜ = mt and potentially
overlapping with limits from tt¯ cross section and spin correlation measurements.
